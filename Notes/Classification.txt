A Quick Guide to the Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a performance measurement for classification problem. It is a table with a combination of predicted and actual values. On the y-axis, we have the True label and on the x-axis we have the Predicted label. This example will focus on a binary classifier, i.e. a yes or no model.

 	Predicted: NO	Predicted: YES
True: NO	30	30
True: YES	10	50
In this matrix, we can see that there are two classes. For example, if we were predicting if an image is a hotdog, "yes" will be a hotdog and "no" will be not a hotdog. We have 120 predictions and out of those times, the classifier predicted "yes" 80 times and "no" 40 times but really, there were 60 "yes"s and 60 "no"s.

When we talk about confusion matrix, we talk about a few terms:

True Positive (TP): Our model predicted "yes", and it was actually "yes"
True Negative (TN): Our model predicted "no", and it was actually "no"
False Positive (FP): Our model predicted "yes", but it was actually "no"
False Negative (FN): Our model predicted "no", but it was actually "yes"
Let's look at it in the context of our example:

 	Predicted: NO	Predicted: YES
True: NO	TN = 30	FP = 30	60
True: YES	FN = 10	TP = 50	60
 	40	80
Accuracy is the number the model got right over the total number of predictions. This is (TP+TN)/Total Number of Oredictions.
